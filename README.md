# 📊 Impact of Co-op on Students’ Career Goals - Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of cooperative education (co-op) on students’ career goals, skills development, and academic preparedness. The dashboard provides interactive insights into students' experiences, helping Drexel educators and institutions enhance co-op programs for better career alignment.

## 🚀 Features
- **Objective Brainstorming**: Identifies key learning areas, skill gaps, and career insights from students' co-op experiences.
- **Student Dashboard**: Visual representation of student responses, showcasing strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement.
- **Employer Dashboard**: Insights into employer expectations and feedback on students' preparedness and performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation. DAX measures used - 18 (8 :Dynamic Rank , 10 : Count, Average, Percentage, Sum (E.g. " Percentage Top Used Skill by Student")
- **Excel**: Data collection and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Textblob & NLTK**: Sentiment Analysis
- **BERT Model**: Classification of sentiment
